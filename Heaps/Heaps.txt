// What are priority queues?

- Queues are data structures with 
collection of objects
are FIFO
example: customers waiting for service

Priority queues:

Collection of prioritized objects
Insertion: According to the first come basis
Removal: based on the priority of the objects
Key is associated when element is inserted in the priority queues
Element with minimum key will be next element to be removed

// Heaps Data Structure

Is a efficient priority queues utilisation

- collection of objects or elements stored as a binary tree
binary heap - also known as
relation property - key in each node of the binary tree is greater than or equal to those in its children
structural property - binary tree should be a complete binary tree
Max Heap and Min Heap

Relational property - the key of each node in binary tree is equal or greater than key
Structureal property states that the binary tree must be complete tree

Heap has got certain properties, and need to specificaly designed, 

operations of heaps

ADT

Insert - inest element in the heap
DeleteMax - delete nad return the maximum element from the heap
Max - return the maximum element from the heap
