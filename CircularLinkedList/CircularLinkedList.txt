// What is circluar linked list
Is a linked list wehre the tail node points back to the head node

[7, 4, 12, 8, 3]

last node is with value of 3, instead of having null reference in the last node, we will have reference to head (first node)
there is no beginning or end of the list ,but we need to keep the reference of the head and tail
the main difference between linked list and circular linked list is that we have to handle how the tail node would reference to the head node

If there is only one node, then the tail and head are pointing at the one node

// Creating circular linked list

// Traversing circular linked list
we will traverse the list through the nodes, till the last, there is no null reference, the last node in list contain reference to the first node.

- repear this part and write down the algoritm on paper

// Insert element at the beginning of the circular linked list

// Insert element anywhere in between the circular linked list
