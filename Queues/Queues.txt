// What is queue data structure?
Queue is a collection of objects
FIFO (First In First Out)
Imagine pipe or queue of cars at drive through
queue have front and end, inserted at end, removed from front
(enqueue - insert) (dequeue - remove)

- applications of queues
used in prinets
access to memory of shared resources
web servers responding to requests
computer applications
some of computer algorithms

- queues abstract data type (ADT)

enqueue(object) - insert element
dequeue() - remove & return element
first() - returns first element
len() - returns number of elements
isEmpty() - whether queue is empty or not

// Queues using arrays

enqueue method - first we will check if the queue is full, if it is full we cannot insert and need to return, 
if it is not full, then we can add the elements

dequeue method won't take any parameters, first we need to check if the queue is empty, if it is empty, then we need to return, we cannot perform any action


// Queues using Linked List
queues using linked list can have insert and remove operations.
insert at front or read, and remove at the front of rear, it is better to use the insert and remove at front of the queue because of time complexity of O(1)


// What are Double Ended Queues
