- push(object): insert element
- pop(): remove & return element
- top(): returns last inserted element, without removing it
- len(): size of the stack
- isEmpty(): whether the stack is empty or not

how to implement stack?
We can use Arrays or Linked List, and the stack abstract data type can be applied

// Stacks using Arrays


// Stacks using Linked List
