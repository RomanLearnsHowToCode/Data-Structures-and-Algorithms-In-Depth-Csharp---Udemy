// Tree Data Structure - its definitions and properties
most important data structures in computing

tree is a non linear data structure - in terms of organisational structures

Tree data structures allows us to implement a number of algorithms much faster than compared to linear data structures such as arrays and linked lists
Tree terminology is derived from familty tree, where we commonly use terminology as: Parent, Child, Ancestor, Descendand 

tree consist of set of nodes
parent child relationship though edges

Parent COMPANY have child as Sales and Manufacruing and edges can be Domestic Sales or International, and for Manufacturing child the edge can be Phones

Number of Nodes = N, Number of Edges = n-1

Tree can be empty = tree which doesn't have any nodes, is known as empty trees

// Trees - terminology
terms used in trees data structures, in non empty tree, this means in trees contains nodes, 

the main node is called ROOT node, other nodes in tree has got parents
siblings - nodes which are members of same parent node are siblings.
external node - is node which doesn't have any children, also known as leaf nodes
internal node - node which has got one or more children
edge - is pair of nodes, (U,V), edge has got always relationship between parent and child
path - is a sequence of nodes such that two consecutive nodes forms an edge, will start from the root nodes, following the edges till the leaf node
subtree - any part of tree or any children is considered as subtree - america is root of the subtree with children north america and south america
forest - is a collection of trees, if we remove the root node, then this tree would break up into several trees

// Height and Levels of Trees
one of the most important terminology
root - heigh 0, level 1, children of the root node are level2 and being considered as height 1, heigh are considered as edges of the tree

// Degree of Node and Tree
degree of a tree is the maximum degree of the node, it is not always the root node which can have the highest degree, it depends on amount of the children the parent 
node have

// Binary trees and its properties
Binary tree is a tree with the following properties
Every Node has at most two children
Every child nodes is labelled as left child or right child
Left child precedes right child in order of Nodes
we can also define a binary tree as a tree with a degree of two
Binary tree -> nodes degree - 0,1,2 
if the binary tree have nodes, where each node have only left nodes, then it is called left skewed binary tree
if the tree have only right nodes then the tree is right skewed binary tree

how many nodes can be in a binary tree of height H?
in a binary tree of height 2 we can have a maximum of 7 nodes
there is a formula to count the maximum nodes by given height - 2 power height + 1, -1

// Proper Binary Tree
proper binary tree - every node can have 0 or 2 children

// Full Binary Tree
full binary tree - every internal node has exactly 2 children and all leaf nodes are at same level
even if parent node has got 2 children, and each child doesn't have any children, it is considered a full binary tree, imagine triangle from 3 nodes A B C where A is root,
B and C are children

there is a forumla for caltulating a full binary tree

// Complete Binary Tree
are numbered from left to right without any gap
gap means gap by numbered nodes, the tree can be incomplete, but cannot have gaps between nodes, such as 1 2 0 4 
must be 1 2 3 0 to be complete

// Full vs Complete vs Proper Binary Tree
explanation of full binary tree, complete binary tree and proper binary tree via examples of trees and nodes

nodes are being counted from lefty to right
conecpt of complete binary trees is used in HEAPS data structure

// Binary Tree Representation - Array Based
if we are creating binary tree from array, then we need to specify the size of array, we need to count how many nodes the binary tree can have, 
so we can store every and each element.

We will store the elements in binary tree from index 1, not from 0, we need array of size 8 if we want to have binary tree of 7 nodes

To store the nodes we should consider the levels of a tree, so root is number 1, then we store from left to right

index is i, left child is i x 2, right child is i x 2 + 1

the formulas are very important fo the operations, and will be also helpful, and will be used in heaps

// Binary Tree Representation - Linked Based
List is a sequence, nodes are elements of binary tree not in sequence, it is linked representation, not that it is linked list representation

node in memory will have three members, element and links to left and right children

// Traversing Binary Trees
methods of traversing
traversing is a technique to visit all elements in a data structure

In linear data structure we can traverse elements from beginning to end or from end to beginning of the data structure

Binary tree is non linear data structure

we can use following methods to traverse through the binary tree

- inorder traversal
- preorder traversal
- postorder traversal
- level order traversal


// Binary Trees Traversal - Preorder
visit root of the binary tree or its subtree
then visit the left subtree recursively preorder
then visit the right subtree resursively preoder
root -> left -> right

preorder traversal

visit root, subtree and its children, then right subtree and its children from left to right
if the tree is deeper, we need to break the binary tree into subtrees, and follow the recursion
