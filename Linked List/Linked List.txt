// What os Linked List?

Arrays:
- arrays are of fixed size - immutable
- once array is declared size cannot be changed
- arrays stores data sequentially in the memory
- data in array must be of same type

Linked List:
- Linked list is a collection of elements, where each element is represented as a node
- Node contain DATA and LINK, link contain a reference where the point 
- When the node is last item in the collection, the link will be null
- How we will access the collection of elements? This is done by link, which stores the memory addres of the nodes
- Linked list is not continuous data structure as arrays are. Arrays have elements side by side

- We are using the Linked lists for following reasons:

Problems with Arrays
- Arrays are of fixed size
- Arrays stores data sequentially in the memory
- we don't know how many elements we need to store

Linked List:
- Add or delete any amount of elements in the data structure
- Efficient utilisation of memory
- NODE is a location in memory, they are not sequential
